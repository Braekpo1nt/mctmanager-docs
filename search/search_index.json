In this example, we'll use <code>Material.STONE</code> for the material, and call the <code>ItemStack</code> variable <code>newGameItem</code>.<ul> <li>Make sure you add your <code>newGameItem</code> to the <code>votingItems</code> Map, like so: <code>votingItems.put(GameType.NEW_GAME, newGame);</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Add a case to the switch statement in <code>clickVoteInventory()</code> for <code>Material.STONE</code> (or whatever material you used).
