# Formatting/Style Guide

Make sure that your formatter isn't wholesale changing large portions of each file you work on. For example, MCTManager includes trailing whitespaces, so if your formatter trims whitespaces then making a single change to a file and saving it may result in hundreds of lines being changed. 

MCTManager isn't formal enough to have a style guide right now, just make sure you're IDE isn't set to "format on save" and double-check your first couple commits to make sure things aren't being changed that you weren't expecting to.
